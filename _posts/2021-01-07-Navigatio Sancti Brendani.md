## Navigatio Sancti Brendani

*Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis* is a story describing a legendary voyage of Brendan of Clonfert (c. AD 484 â€“ c. 577). Many versions were circulating in Europe from the 10th century. The story is plainly a Christian narrative, but also narrates natural phenomena and fantastical events and places, which appealed to a broad audience. It narrates the voyage of Brendan to find the Promised Land of the Saints.
